# Python Resources

A place to share useful resources on all things Python :books:

Contents:
* Python Guidance for PHI: GitHub can not render the python notebook (.ipynb) properly. To view it, you can 
  * Download the github repository and open "Python Guidance for PHI.ipynb" in Jupyter Notebook. Or 
  * View it at https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Health-SocialCare-Scotland/Python-Resources/blob/master/Python%20Guidance%20for%20PHI.ipynb?flush_cache=true (Sometimes it can take a while for the updates to show in nbviewer. That's why I put "?flush_cache=true" at the end of the URL to clear the cache so that the updates can show up). There is a button on the top right "Download Notebook". If you right click on it and select "Save link as", you can also download "Python Guidance for PHI.ipynb" and open it in Jupyter Notebook. 
  
If you want to update any files, please create your own branch from master and raise a pull request. You can set someone (usually Tina815 or calump96 from Stats Governance Team) as a reviewer. After the pull request has been reviewed, it will be merged to the master and the side branch will be deleted.
